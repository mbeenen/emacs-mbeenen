My emacs settings.

Make sure to run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to get the latest version of the submodules under site-lisp

Should pretty much work out of the box with the following code in .emacs:

(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/emacs-mbeenen")
(load-file "/path/to/emacs-mbeenen/home-emacs.el")

Currently works with Emacs 24
